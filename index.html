                        <h2> About Me </h2>
                        <p>Hello, my name is Alexa Griffith. I am a Senior Software Engineer at Bloomberg working on their Data Science Platform's Inference team. 
                            I work to build a platform for data scientists to deploy their models into production and get prediction (inference) results. I am a contributor and reviewer for both <a href="https://github.com/kserve/kserve"> kserve/kserve </a> and  
                            <a href="https://github.com/kserve/website"> kserve/website </a> projects. 
                            
                            I'm from Tennessee, and I graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in May, 2019. 
                            Previously, I was a Software Engineer on the Analytics Infrastructure team for Bluecore in New York City, where I worked for ~2.5 years. 
                            I worked on the Data Science Infrastructure team for ~1 year before moving to a newly created Analytics Infrastructure team to build an analytics pipeline. 
                            On Data Science Infrastructure, I aided the data scientists in running their models, and helped build/maintain our systems, like our recommendations service.
                            On Analytics Infrastructure, I built out a new Go API that runs in Kubernetes, I worked on solving auth for our microservices that receive requests from the browser, 
                            and I have done a little work on our streaming platform.
                            Before that, I graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in May, 2019 with an honors degree in Chemistry and minor in Spanish. While 
                            at UTK, I did research in computational chemistry and interned at Oak Ridge National Lab. 
                            I've worked with Airflow, Kubernetes, Docker, Google Cloud Platform, Golang, Python, Argo, and more!
                            
                            I enjoy my team and the exciting, challenging nature of my work. 
                            I write tech blogs about things I am working on or learning about, but recently I have been busy hosting a tech podcast called Alexa's Input (AI).
                            I also love to read, and I even write about reading sometimes.
                        </p>
